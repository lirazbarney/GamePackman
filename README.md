My interpertion of the pac-man game.
I Started it long ago while I was in the army. after some time, I decided I want to try and complete the game.
This is one of my first projects I did on my own, for my own enjoyment.
The game is written fully in Java and was made with inelliJ IDE.
First added to GitHub and started working on it again - 08/2024.
Lets start eating those yellow balls #WabbaWabba :)
